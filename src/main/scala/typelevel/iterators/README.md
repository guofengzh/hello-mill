Two theoretical tools for exploring type systems
  λ-cube - visual
  PTS (Pure Type Systems) framework - definitional

λ-cube

Visualizes three "dimensions" of type-system abstraction. What is this abstraction? Informally, it's mutual dependency of types and terms:
  term - term (typed lambda calculi)
  terms - type (polymorphism)
  type - term (dependent types)
  type - type (higher-order types)
